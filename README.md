# Simple-Hotel-Reservation-System
### Simple Hotel Reservation System with login credentials using c++. 
> ---
This was my first semester c++ project in my BSCS degree. The project was to make a hotel reservation system using Loops and arrays.
> ---
The key points of this project are:
1. Login credentials.
2. Hotel with three flours, each having 10 rooms.
3. The user can choose the flour and room to book. The room will be booked if available, else it will display that the room is booked.
4. It will also check if the entered room is valid or not.
5. At last, it will ask the user to end the task or continue booking.
